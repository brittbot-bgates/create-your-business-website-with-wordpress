## About The Author

Hello, my name is Brittany Gates and I’m a data center aficionado and creative writer. I’ve worked in the IT Industry for fifteen years now. By day I work in a data center for a Silicon Valley company and by night I write. Oh, and I also run a few websites built with WordPress.

My history with WordPress is over a decade old now. I started using it around 2007, and over the years I’ve watched the software improve not only in features but also in its appearance and security.

This guide allows me to use all my skills as I’m going to teach you how to create a WordPress website for your business. This won't be short nor easy process because building a website is time-consuming and difficult at certain points. Which is why so many business owners hire a company or an agency. 

## Why WordPress?

You’re probably wondering why I choose WordPress to build my websites. And why I recommend it to everyone who ask me what software or framework to use to create a website. Especially when there are are cloud-based services like Wix and Squarespace. Well, it’s because I love WordPress and open source software. As the tagline states on WordPress' website: "Create a place for your business, your interests, or anything else—with the open source platform that powers the web[wordpress.org](wordpress.org).”

Also, its mission is simple: It is designed for everyone, is open-source, and is welcoming and inclusive. Thus, anyone can share their thoughts, feelings, or create a business with WordPress.

WordPress was created in 2003 by Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg and is operated by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). While WordPress was originally created for blogging you can use it now to create various types of websites. And this versatility makes it a great choice for businesses.

It’s also a Content Management System [CMS](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/). This system allows you to not only create digital content (like blog posts, music files, videos, etc.) but modify them. Also, WordPress can also be considered a Web Content Management (WCM) system because it provides the ability for individuals to create and/or add images, photos, music, videos, and much more.

CMS is broken up into two parts:
* Content Management Application (CMA) 
* Content Delivery Application (CDA) 

The CMA allows inexperienced users to create, update, or delete content from a website without the aid of experienced professional. Years ago you would have to hire a Webmaster or a Web Developer for this type of work.

The CDA does all the heavy lifting in the background because it takes all the pictures, text, and other information you supplied and puts it all together. Thus, it creates everything you see on the website. Finally, the CDA has the job of updating the website.

WordPress is not only the only CMS used to build websites, and its competitors are Drupal, Joomla, and ModX. However, WordPress has the most market share out of all these systems. At the time of publication 42% of the Web uses WordPress.

I wrote quite a bit to convince you but now I want to discuss some of WordPress’ benefits in more detail.

## Its Popularity Created A Vast Ecosystem

I already discussed the large market share WordPress has for website creation. And due to that popularity other developers created a vast ecosystem over time to extend the capabilities of the software. These individuals created thousands of free and non-free themes and plugins for the public to use. These themes and plugins allow WordPress to be transformed into a retail online store or a membership website. Because these developers saw successful from their labors they are fully invested in improving WordPress.

I will go into more detail about these themes and plugins later on in the guide. And I’ll tell you which ones are critical to the success of your site, and others that are good to have because they provide additional features.

## One-Click Auto-Install Makes Installation A Breeze

When I started using WordPress back in 2007 the installation was difficult, to say the least. I followed the “Basic Instructions” posted here. If you didn’t follow these instructions or weren’t tech savvy you would run into issues. It was common to install the software improperly or connect your database incorrectly. And many people, myself included, edited their core WordPress files incorrectly, causing their sites to crash.

Yet, with “Automated Installation” (also called one-click installation) normal now with various web hosting companies, beginners can install WordPress within minutes by filling in a few details. As a result of this, I can get installations up and running in a quick manner. This is fantastic when I need to spin up a site for testing.

## The WordPress UI Is Intuitive

WordPress’ User Interface (UI) is intuitive now. The side menu has all of the functions you need, such as “Posts” and “Media,” right there so you don’t have to search for them. In addition, each function’s name tells you what it exactly does. “Posts” allow you to create a blog post. “Pages” is when you want to create a page on your site. “Media” contains pictures, videos, music, and other media.

## Enhanced Blogging & Content Creation Capabilities

WordPress is still the best CMS to use for blog creation. Yes, there sites like Medium and Tumblr, but those sites don’t offer the plugins or configurations this software offers.

Even though you can create websites with WordPress, its focus was and is blogging. And that’s improved drastically over the years. Writing posts is a breeze! I can add animated GIFs with a few clicks. When I want to slip in headings and sub-headings those are also just a few clicks of your mouse or trackpad. Finally, when I want to add a “Featured Image” (the image that shows up above the blog post) or an image within the body of my text, I can upload one and then insert it in under a minute.

Finally, if you need to share files (like documents) WordPress allows for that too. All you have to do is upload the files using their software and add them to your site with a few clicks of your mouse or trackpad.

## WordPress Block Editor Works Well Now

WordPress made it very simple to create blog posts and pages with the new WordPress Editor / Gutenberg update in 2018. However, this update divided users during its beta because it introduced major changes on how to create and edit content. And when new editor became the default in WordPress users were highly upset. However, you can re-enable the Classic Editor via a plugin if you so choose. As for me, I really enjoy using the Block Editor. It simplifies the addition of text, headings, images, video, and now even podcasts into your blog posts and/or pages.

# [Chapter 1: Purchase A Domain Name & Web Hosting](#chapter1)

In this step I discuss what a domain name is, how to buy one, and how to choose the proper web hosting provider for your website. This step, in my opinion, is the most important part of your website because you must choose a domain name that is not only easy to remember but is not too long. In addition, the web hosting company you choose can make or break the performance of your site.

I highly recommend you do not skimp on the costs when it comes to choosing a good domain name or web hosting. Although I don’t want you to choose the most expensive domain name or hosting plan either, I just stress that if you go the cheap route you will get what you pay for. Either your hosting plan will have slower performance, or you won’t have enough storage for your files, or the web hosting company will have subpar customer service. And if you find yourself in this situation then you will have to spend more money to resolve the issue. (Except bad customer service as you usually can’t buy a better version of it.)

## How To Buy A Domain Name For Your Business

### What Is A Domain Name?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name): “A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet.”

Here are some examples of domain names:
* amazon.com
* ebay.com
* newegg.com

### Create An Original Name

A problem that individuals or businesses run into when it comes to their domain name is they create one that’s too similar to another company. Sometimes these names mimic ones held by popular companies which can cause problems. 
One problem is the public could confuse the new business’ domain name with the popular company. Thus, this could cause brand issues.

The second problem, which could lead to legal issues, is when an individual or business register a domain name that’s almost exactly the same as another company. Here’s an example of that:

Let’s say you decide to register the domain name goog.com. This name is too similar to google.com. And this name could confuse some of Google’s customers to think your website and/or business is related to Google’s products and services. Because of this Google decides to send their Legal team after you because you’re infringing on their trademark and/or brand. And they have done so in the past. [Google sued the owner(s) behind oogle.com in 2012](https://dnattorney.com/google-loses-oogle-com-domain-name-dispute/).

If you think that domain names can’t get a trademark [Nolo discusses how these can](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/domain-names-trademarks-faq.html). If you would like to learn more about this so you and your business don’t run afoul of infringing on another company’s trademark, [Donut](https://www.lawdonut.co.uk/business/contracts-disputes/ip-disputes/domain-name-disputes-faqs) has a great FAQ section about this topic. Also, The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has a [page](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en) devoted to this too. This group coordinates the domain names, among other things, of the Internet.

To create an original name you can use your name and the industry you work in. This works pretty well if you sell services. Let’s say your name is Robert Johnson and you run a HVAC company. You could create a domain name like “johnsonhvac.com” or rjohnsonhvac.com” or johnsonheatingandair.com.”

However, if you operate a business selling goods then you may want to create an original name along whatever goods you’re selling. Let’s say you sell health and beauty products using organic coconut oil. You could create a domain name based around your product line name.

### Use Business Name Generator To Create A Domain Name 
A great way to create an original domain name if you’re having trouble creating one is to use a business name generator. In doing so you will get a list of business names by entering words suited to your business and/or industry.

Using [BusinessNameGenerator](https://businessnamegenerator.com/), let’s look at the names I get when I enter the following for specific industries:

Education
* Educatdo 
* Totorhut 
* Teachingly

Fitness 
* Fitnetic 
* Fitfluent 
* Workoutpad 

Food & Drink 
* Smack Burgers 
* Barscape 
* Winesy

Music 
* Musadora 
* Musdeck 
* Beatsable 

Retail 
* Clothinglux 
* Fashnest 
* Decorverse

Some of these names were available for purchase while others were already taken. Your results will be different but this is a good option to try.

### When To Buy Your Domain Name

If you are sitting around one day, or standing in line somewhere, or have a dream and the idea of a particular domain name hits you then you need to buy it. Only because these ideas usually don’t come around again.

When you are working toward opening a business then you need to buy your domain name ahead of time. I bought the domain name for my upcoming Ecommerce store, [letsallmeat.com](letsallmeat.com), long before I even thought of opening the business.

Yes, there’s the possibility you could change your business name after you bought the domain name. Which is why I suggest to register your domain name for one year when you first start. Domain names aren’t that expensive, and range in price from $8 to $50, depending on the registrar and the Top Level Domain (TLD) chosen. So if you happen to not use that domain in favor of another one then you’re not out that much money.

### How Long To Buy Your Domain Name

When it comes to the length of how long you purchase your domain name the default is 1 year. However, many domain registrars allow you to add years for an additional cost.

The benefit of this is to: 
1. Save money 
2. Less likely to forget to renew your name. 

Yep, once you buy a domain name you have to renew it every year. It’s like car registration. 

I used to only buy 1 year terms for my domain names but I’ve recently switched to multi-year terms because the cost savings are better. Yet, it’s fine if you decide to buy only one year plans. 

Finally, I have my domain names set to auto-renew and keep a valid credit card on file. I still get an email from my domain registrar stating it’s time to renew my name, but if I miss that email then I don’t have to worry about forgetting to renew my name. 

What happens if you don’t renew? First, your website stops working because it’s no longer connected to the name. That’s because your domain registrar will move the name back into the pool of availability for others to purchase. And if someone else buys it then you have to buy it from them (if you can). 

### Choose A Generic Top-Level Domain 

Before you search to see if a potential domain name is available, you first must decide which [generic top-level domain (TLD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain) you will use. Here’s a short list of generic TLDs currently available from various domain registrars:
* .com 
* .net 
* .org 
* .dev 
* .app 
* .inc 
* .website 

Most people choose the .com TLD because it’s the most popular. Due to that, sometimes it’s difficult to use a specific name for your website because it’s already taken. If that happens and you really want the name it could be for sale. You will know if you see a “Make Offer” or something similar button. This will start the process of offering to buy the domain name but be warned: You may have to spend a massive amount of money to do so.

### Should You Buy Multiple / All TLDs For Your Chosen Name?

You finally bought your domain name for your websites, let’s use example.com for this scenario. The domain registrar shows you various other TLDs available for your name. Now you’re wondering should you buy example.net and example.org and example.dev because you want to protect your trademark and/or your brand. Should you do that? Is that a great idea?
 
Google, and other major companies, do this because if they waited to buy the other TLDs later someone else could buy that TLDs. People do this because they’re hoping you’ll want to buy it later and they can sell it for a nice profit. This is called [Cybersquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting) (also called Domain Squatting) and there are laws about this in America and in some countries.

Finally, I highly suggest you don’t buy some non-popular TLDs like example.golf or recently launched TLDs. Mostly because they don’t have the name recognition like a .com or a .net.

### When To Purchase A Premium Domain Name

During your search you are bound to come across a Premium domain name. What are those? According to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/) Premium domain names “are short domains, often made up of just one word or 3-5 letters. They are also known as ‘aftermarket’ or ‘pre-registered’ domains.” Good examples of these types of names: 
* google.com 
* facebook.com 
* aarp.com

These names are catchy and short, which is gold when it comes to marketing. That’s why I suggest you consider one if you can 1) afford it and 2) it will advertise your brand very well. [Namecheap wrote a blog post](https://www.namecheap.com/blog/pay-big-bucks-aftermarket-domains/) about several companies spending $10,000+ for their premium domain names. While this price tag is expensive for many individuals and/or companies, you can look at the investment as part of building your brand.

### Always Choose WhoisGuard

When you buy a domain name from a domain registrar always elect to enable [WhoisGuard](http://www.whoisguard.com/). Even if the option cost additional money. Why? And what does it do? According to their website: “WhoisGuard avoids this issues by placing our information in whois and provides an option to redirect email and regular mail to the customer’s real address. During the process of transferring the email, we try to avoid obvious junk email and regular mail, thus relieving the customer from junk.”

When you buy a domain name, you have to input the name of owner, the address of the company, and a phone number. That information is publicly available, meaning spammers or stalkers or anyone could call you, spam you, or just bother you. And if you are buying a domain name for personal use or running a home-based business, your personal information would be available too. You don’t want that.

### The Domain Registrar I Recommend

When it comes to buying a domain name I only use [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I’ve used them for 16 years (as of the publication of this book) and always get great support from them. And they offer WhoisGuard for free forever.

I also buy other products from them, like SSL certs (which I’ll discuss later in this guide) and web hosting for my WordPress sites.

Finally, Namecheap has very good prices when it comes to domain names. You can get a .com TLD for $8.88 a year! And if you catch one of their sales (which is often) you can get a .com TLD cheaper than that.

## How To Choose The Proper Web Hosting Provider For Your Website 

In this section I’ll give you tips on how to buy the proper web hosting provider for your website. There’s some many providers to choose from and sometimes you can’t go by reviews alone. 

I’ll also compare Managed versus Shared web hosting, which are two of the most popular options and are inexpensive to buy. In that comparison I’ll show the pros and cons of each, and then give my final recommend on which type you should use for your site. 

### What Is Web Hosting? 
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service): “A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center.”

Web hosting companies have servers in a [data center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center) and then rent those for customer use. What are [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))? Think of them as bigger and more power computers. Servers have higher-end CPUs, more memory, larger capacity storage disks, and high-bandwidth network ports to allow multiple users access it at once to get the information they need. 

When you purchase a web hosting package, the company takes one of the servers they own and prepares a portion of it for you to use. 

There are different types of web hosting packages: 
* Managed hosting 
* Shared hosting 
* Virtual Private Server (VPS) 
* Dedicated servers 

In this guide I’m not going to discuss VPS or Dedicated servers because those are usually geared toward high-traffic websites, or experienced owners who want complete control over their server. And these options are the most expensive web hosting packages. 

### Managed Hosting 

This hosting is usually the cheapest package you can buy. It is sometimes advertised as “WordPress Hosting.” It is inexpensive because the web hosting company controls the entire server. You, the tenant on the server, has no control over the operating system used on the server or the software running it. However, you don’t have to do any maintenance on it either. 

Let’s look at the pros and cons: 

**Pros:** 
* Very inexpensive price plans. 
* Great for personal blogs or small websites / businesses. 
* The web hosting company performs all the updates to the servers, including WordPress core updates (not plugins, however). 

**Cons:** 
* The servers offered usually have lower technical specifications, so if your website grows significantly your performance can suffer. 
* You do not have access to the back-end applications so you may not have access to cPanel. 
* If you need SFTP or database access, you may or may not have access to it. If you do have access to it you may have to go through a process to enable it. 

### Shared Hosting 

This hosting is more expensive than managed hosting because you will get more access to certain back-end applications. And these packages offer more CPUs, storage space, and memory. Just like with Managed Hosting the hosting company controls the server and you as the tenant have no control over the operating system or the software running on it. 

**Pros:** 
* Affordable prices plans. 
* Great for small & medium business websites. 
* The web hosting company performs all the updates to the servers, including software update (probably not WordPress core updates, however). 
* You have access to cPanel, SFTP, and database access. 
* Some companies offer a website builder program. 

**Cons:** 
* The cheapest plans can have sparse features, meaning you will have to spend more if you need additional features. 
* Some companies offer free services with a chosen plan (like domain name or SSL certificates), but those services become non-free after a period of time. 

### Which Hosting Is Right For Your Business Website? 

If you want to build a small business website and don’t want to handle any of the updates (except WordPress updates), then I recommend you purchase Managed Hosting. If your site grows larger and you need more storage space or memory then you can purchase Shared Hosting and transfer everything over. 

However, if you want to run an Ecommerce website or your business provides web applications then choose Shared Hosting. Due to the improve servers your sites will perform better. You can’t have a slow website because that will drive your visitors and customers away. 

### The Web Hosting Company I Recommend (And Use) 

When it comes to Managed Hosting I use and recommend [EasyWP](https://www.easywp.com/) by Namecheap. You can start for free for 30 days and there isn’t a commitment if the service doesn’t work out for you. 

There are three packages to choose from: 
* Starter 
* Turbo 
* Supersonic 

If you are just starting out and don’t think your business website will be popular at first then you can begin with the Starter package. However, it may be better to choose the Turbo package because you get more storage space along with more CPUs and memory. Supersonic is great for businesses that require constant uptime along with more storage, CPU, and memory. 

Here are a few features of EasyWP: 
* Hosted on Namecheap Cloud 
* Support for any domain name provider: You can buy your domain name from any domain registrar. 
* Easy-to-use dashboard to manage WordPress websites: You don’t have to spend much time trying to find the information you need. 
* Safe and secure 
* Easy backups and restores 
* SFTP and database access: These allow you to not only transfer files to and from your site, but you can modify or update your database. 

As for Shared Hosting I also use and recommend Namecheap. There are three packages to choose from: 
* Stellar 
* Stellar Plus 
* Stellar Business 

I use Stellar Business for my Ecommerce site because it’s the only PCI-compatible hosting package out of the collection. And this package provides not only auto-backups but cloud storage (which promises 100% uptime along with stability and data protection). 

Here are a few features of Shared Hosting: 
* Unmetered bandwidth: You can have as much traffic coming and going to and from your website. 
* Free domain name and privacy protection: You can register your domain name for free for the first year. 
* Free automatic SSL installation: Get a free SSL certificate for the first year. 
* Free in <24 hours website migration: If you have a website hosted somewhere else you can transfer it to Namecheap and have it up and running under 24 hours. 

This hosting package also works well with WordPress if you don’t want to go the EasyWP route, or if that hosting doesn’t fit your business needs. With Namecheap’s Shared Hosting you can install WordPress with one-click and do all its administrative tasks through [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/). Finally, you will get an email service which allows you to create email accounts and build mailing lists. 

The final reason why I use and recommend Namecheap is their customer service. While you may find other web hosting companies offering cheaper packages their customer service can be lackluster. And when you have an issue with your site or if you have a crucial question you need top-notch service. Every time I’ve contacted Namecheap’s customer service I’ve gotten prompt replies to my questions. Yeah, sometimes I had to wait for several minutes but that’s normal. As for my issues that required additional technical support they were resolved within 24 to 48 hours. 

### Should You Consider Using WordPress.com? 

This guide focuses on you building a website using self-hosted WordPress. However, there is wordpress.com which is Automattic’s solution for those who want to use WordPress but not handle the software’s maintenance. And you don’t have to worry about choosing a web hosting company or need website design knowledge. 
Here are the pros and cons of wordpress.com: 

**Pros:** 
* You don’t have to perform any website maintenance as it’s handled by the company. 
* Very simple website creation through the use of themes and blocks. 
* Thousands of free plugins available. 
* Marketing tools like Mailchimp or website analytics tools like Google Analytics are built-in. 
* You can update your website on your smartphone via the WordPress app. 
* Free SSL certificate installed so your site is secure. 

**Cons:** 
* Their plans are more expensive than many Managed and Shared Hosting packages offered by other companies. 
* To get the additional features, you must pay for them. 
* If you require priority support, you must choose the more expensive plans. 
* You can’t remove the WordPress.com branding without paying for more expensive plans. 

Should choose wordpress.com to build your business website? Yes if you want any of the following: 
* If you need website that just works. 
* You want to run an Ecommerce store and need technical support. 
* If you don’t feel comfortable with website design or don’t have the time to learn it. 

Now if you go this route prepare to pay more than you would for self-hosted WordPress. Although wordpress.com has a free package you’re not going to get much in terms of features. You will soon find out you’ll need to upgrade to one of the paid packages which can be quite expensive per month. And if you choose the “pay monthly” option you won’t get the free domain name for a year. 

### Should You Use WordPress’ Recommended Hosting Partners? 
If you don’t go with my web hosting provider recommendation you’ll need to find another. However, there’s so many providers to choose from you’re going to look for reviews online. One place you may look at first is WordPress’ website because they have a section all about hosting. They recommend the following web hosts: 
* Bluehost 
* DreamHost 
* SiteGround. 

In my opinion, Bluehost is expensive, DreamHost is the best economical choice, and SiteGround is also affordable but their plans' features can be scant when compared to DreamHost. Out of the three I would choose DreamHost.

# [Chapter 2: Install The Proper SSL Certificate](#chapter2)

After visiting dozens of small business websites for a project I worked on this past year I discovered too many of them do not use SSL certificates on their website, or only parts of them. The sites that did the latter only secured their sign-in pages and/or their cart/checkout page. Although this is fine, your entire website needs protection.

## What Is An SSL Certificate?

A Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Certificate encrypts traffic, transforming it from HTTP (unsecured) to HTTPS (secured). Also, this certificate protects information, especially sensitive material (like credit card numbers or protected health information) from bad actors, like hackers.

This certificate protects your website from these bad actors through [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). Think of this protection as your house address. This is public information and anyone can come to your house. Thus, your public key. However, there is a lock on your door which keeps those individuals from entering your house. Only you can enter your house with the proper key. Hence, your private key.

When you buy a certificate to secure your website, you have to create a public and private key. Then when your website transmits data one part of the transmission is encrypted with the public key, and the other part is decrypted with the private key.

This only a quick overview. If you would like to learn more about SSL certificates please view this website [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/).

## Why You Need SSL Certificates For Your Entire Website

Your entire website needs a SSL certificate because it affects your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) rankings. Google takes web security seriously and gives websites with better security higher rankings in their searches over non-secured websites. [Neil Patel did an extensive write-up on his website showing the data proving Google favors websites employing entire website security](https://neilpatel.com/blog/does-a-ssl-certificate-affect-your-seo-a-data-driven-answer/).

Also, having a SSL certificate installed for your entire website puts your visitors’ minds at ease. If someone visits your website and sees the homepage isn’t secure, and they can see that from the browser bar easily, then that visitor may be less likely to order your product or service. I know I would.

## SSL Certificates Are Inexpensive And Provide Good ROI

[You can get SSL certificates for free](https://letsencrypt.org/) or you can buy them for a fair price. I buy my SSL certificates from Namecheap and I recommend them.

Even if you have a buy an expensive certificate they provide a good return on investment. The ones I get through Comodo provide warranties. Meaning if the company fails to properly validate my certificate during the course of business, and that leads to loss or money or business, then I can submit a warranty claim for compensation. Namecheap explains more in [their article](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/885/38/ssl-certificate-warranty/).

Finally, when a visitor sees your website is secure, it makes them feel good, and can lead to them spending money on your goods and/or services.

## The Types Of SSL Certificates Available For Purchase

There are three types of SSL certificates you can purchase for your website:
* Domain Validated (DV)
* Organization Validated (OV)
* Extended Validation (EV)

While each certificate provides the same type of encryption, they differ on how the security companies verify the organization before they issue the certificate.

Domain Validated has the least checks done as the security organization only checks if the owner has the right to use a specific domain name. This is usually done by having the owner add a specific Domain Name System (DNS) entry through their web hosting company. The security company doesn’t check to make sure the owner is the actual owner, or says who he/she says he/she is.

The reason DV certificates are used because they are inexpensive, good for personal use like blogs, and they are issued almost instantly.

As for Organization Validated certificates the security company checks that the owner has the right to use the domain name and vets some of the information about the organization or business. And that information is displayed to visitors when they check the security icon in their browser. This gives visitors a better since of security as to who their private information is going to.

Unlike DV certificates, OV ones take more time to be issued because the security company has to vet the applicant.

Finally, Extended Validation certificates acts just like the OV but the security company vets the owner thoroughly. They check the legal, physical, and operational existence of the business. Then they verify that the identity matches those on official records. Finally the security company verify that the owner or organization initiated the certificate issuance.

# Which One Should You Pick For Your Business Website?

For personal websites like blogs I would go with a DV as it’s inexpensive (or free if you choose to use Let's Encrypt). That’s what I use for my blogs and other websites that don’t have a login portal for customers.

If you are building an Ecommerce website I highly suggest you choose either a OV or EV certificate. Although these will cost more and require you to submit documentation regarding the ownership of your business, they can build higher trust within your visitors upon landing on your site. Also, these certificates provide higher warranties. Depending on where you purchase your SSL certificates warranties range from $100,000 to over $1,000,000.

For my Ecommerce store I went with an OV certificate. Although I had to submit a form online about my business so the security company could validate it the process wasn’t difficult. You just have to make sure your business or organization is registered in some well-known databases beforehand. If you don’t, it will delay the issuance of your certificate.

Finally, if you’re building a website that will have a login portal for customers you also want to invest in a OV or EV certificate. Again, you need to encrypt customer’s sensitive data, like login credentials, so bad actors can’t grab them.

## Where Can You Buy SSL Certificates?

You can purchase SSL certificates from your web hosting company, but you can also purchase them directly from security companies. I highly suggest the former option because it makes installing the certificate easier. And you’ll probably get the best price.

I use and recommend Namecheap because their prices are fair. And you will save a good amount of money if you purchase a multi-year certificate.

If you don’t want to go through your web hosting company or my recommendation then you can buy certificates from the following:
* [ComodoCA](https://ssl.comodo.com/)
* [GlobalSign](https://shop.globalsign.com/en/ssl-tls-certificates)
* [Digicert](https://www.digicert.com/)
* [Sectigo](https://sectigo.com/products)

Warning: You may not get the best prices by buying the certificates directly from these companies. And you will be on your own installing it onto your website. Your web hosting company may have instructions how to do that or may not. Thus, you may have to ask the certification provider for installation instructions.

## Can You Use Let’s Encrypt Certificates?

Your web hosting company may offer free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates and you may want to use these instead. While you can use these certificates they should only be used on personal sites (like blogs).

Why? Here’s [the group’s explanation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/#what-services-does-let-s-encrypt-offer) about the certificates they issue: “Let’s Encrypt is a global Certificate Authority (CA). We let people and organizations around the world obtain, renew, and manage SSL/TLS certificates. Our certificates can be used by websites to enable secure HTTPS connections. Let’s Encrypt offers Domain Validation (DV) certificates. We do not offer Organization Validation (OV) or Extended Validation (EV) primarily because we cannot automate issuance for those types of certificates.”

# [Chapter 3: Secure Your WordPress Installation](#chapter3)

All day everyday individuals attack your website. And not only your website but also your hosting provider. Who are these people? Usually [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker), [crackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker#Cracker), scammers, or [script kiddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie). So how can you keep them out of your website and protect your WordPress installation. I give you several options and some tools to combat these bad actors while protecting your website.

## Start At Your Web Hosting Provider

The first place you should start when it comes to protecting your website is securing your web hosting account. If a bad actor gets control over it, they can delete your website or hold it ransom. Others could use your account to buy additional hosting space to send spam mail or run attacks against others, like a [DDoS attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).

So how do you secure your web hosting account?

First, you need to use an original password. If you a reused password, meaning one you used for another website, stop reading now and change the password immediately! Hackers have access to password lists from previous breaches. They try these credentials at other websites to see if they are reused. [Unfortunately, they are](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/reusing-passwords/).

A great way to develop an original password is to use a password manager. I use [1Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) now to not only save and manager my passwords, but to generate new secure passwords.

Next, you need to enable [two-factor authentication](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-and-why-to-use-two-factor-authentication/) (2FA) on your account. This adds another layer of protection even if a hacker gets your password because 2FA requires a code or phrase. And this code or phrase changes constantly. Depending on your web hosting company, you can use one of the following 2FA methods:
* SMS text message
* Authentication program (Authy or Google Authenticator)
* Keyfob/security key

SMS text message is basic protection that can be intercepted by bad actors. Authentication programs like Authy is much better, however this can be defeated too if a hacker performs a [SIM-swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam). Yet, this can be uncommon as it takes quite a bit of work by a bad actor to perform a successful SIM-swap. The best protection is a keyfob (also called a security key). Your web hosting provider may or may not allow this type of 2FA so please check with them before buying a keyfob. If they do and need suggestions about which one to get, [The Verge wrote a good article comparing the various ones](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f).

Finally, only allow certain individuals access to your web hosting account if you work with a team of people. And each user should have their own password. Do not allow multiple people to use one account.

The first reason behind this is you can’t tell who accessed the account. So if there is a security incident you can’t determine which individual did it. The second reason is if one user account gets hacked you can sign into another to lock out the hacked user account.

## Securing Your WordPress Admin Account

Securing your WordPress administrative account is key. If a hacker or scammer is able to take control over this account, again they can delete your website or deface it or hold it for ransom.

So how can you secure it?

Just like with your web hosting account, use an original password for the WordPress admin account. Next, enable 2FA on that account. With self-hosted WordPress, you will have to use a security plugin like [WordFence](https://www.wordfence.com/) to do so.

Also consider changing the login URL. It’s widely known to add “/wp-admin/” or “wp-login.php” to the end of URL to access the WP login page. From there, hackers can try to login using the default username and password. The best way to change your login URL is to use a plugin. [Change wp-admin login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/change-wp-admin-login/) is a good choice and the one I use.

Speaking of the default username, WordPress provides “admin” which you shouldn’t accept. Type in a different username. However, if you use “admin” you can change it by following the instructions on [this site](https://themeisle.com/blog/change-wordpress-usernames/).

## WordPress Admin Usernames To Avoid

When you’re configuring your WordPress installation you’ll be asked to provide an admin username. Do not use any of the following as your username:
* admin
* demo
* test
* login
* editor

These are well-known usernames by hackers so they try these names first.

## How To Create A Good WordPress Admin Username

I know some people who use password generators to create a random string of characters and use that as an username. This is very secure yet it’s hard to remember. Plus, if you are managing multiple WordPress sites, choosing this option can make administration more difficult.

Other people use their first name or a combination of their first and last name as their admin username. While this is a fine strategy, people can still guess it if your name is associated with the website. I use my name on my personal website. Thus, I don’t use any part of my name in my admin username.

Finally, I know people who use nicknames as their WordPress admin username because it’s easy to remember. This can work if people don’t know that individual goes by a nickname.

## Enable Notifications And/Or Alerts For Different Methods

I highly suggest when it comes to protecting your website you must enable notifications and/or alerts for whenever a person logs in correctly or incorrectly. This way you know immediately when someone logged into the web hosting company or the WordPress administrative account.

Also, you should send these alerts through different methods, such as email and text message. That way if a hacker gets control of your website and your email, you still can get notifications through another avenue.

I use WordFence Security for my websites and I get emails whenever someone successfully and unsuccessfully logs in. The same happens whenever I login or make any change or order through my web hosting company.

How to set this up is going to depend on your hosting company. Review their “Knowledge Base” or “Help” section for assistance.

# [Chapter 4: How To Setup A WordPress Development Environment](#chapter4)

In this chapter I will teach you how to setup a WordPress development environment. This is crucial when it comes to building your website so the public will not see your work in progress. Also, you need a development environment so you can test out major updates in the future.

This environment can be remote (on a server on the Internet) or local (using software installed on your computer). For this guide I’m going to focus on installing a local development system on your computer due to its ease and doesn’t require an Internet connection.

You can use the following tools to create a local development system:
* Local by Flywheel
* MAMP

## Local by Flywheel

[Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) works on Windows, Mac, and Linux (Debian versions). It is free to use but you do have to sign up to use it.

You’re probably wondering how this software is free with all of the features it offers. Well, the company behind it, Flywheel, sells managed WordPress hosting. Thus, they are hoping that once you use their free product you will then pay the money to transfer your site onto one of their hosting plans. Unfortunately, their plans are quite expensive. The “Tiny” plan is $150 a year and you get scant storage space and bandwidth for that price.

Once you open the software you will create a project and then go through the motions to install WordPress and go through the setup as you normally would on your web hosting company. Upon setup’s completion you will have access to the admin dashboard and can begin customizing your site by choosing a theme, installing plugins, and adding content.

From here, you can view what your website looks like and make tweaks as needed.

## MAMP

[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) is free software you can install on Windows or [Mac](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/?m=1629109578&) but you don’t have to sign up to use it. It works pretty much like Local by Flywheel, however the User Interface is different.

There is a non-free professional edition of this software called MAMP PRO. The biggest reason to buy this version is if you need the ability to create separate hosts for each of your projects. If you require that functionality then [please check out their pricing](https://www.mamp.info/en/store/?m=1629117968&).

# [Chapter 5: How To Build Your Site And Hide It From Visitors](#chapter5)

In this section I will tell you how to build your website directly on the storage space you bought from your web hosting company and hide it from visitors. You can choose this option if you don’t want to setup a local development environment on your computer. I choose this option because I rather test my site on the actual hardware it’s going to be running on constantly instead of my computer.

## Enable Maintenance Mode Through Your Web Hosting Provider

Many web hosting providers offer some type of maintenance mode (sometimes called a “Coming Soon” page) which will hide your site from visitors. Instead, they will see a very simple page and/or greeting like "We'll be back soon" or "Page under construction." Depending on your web hosting provider the maintenance mode or Coming Soon page can be more colorful.

To find out how to enable this mode check the “Help” section or the “Knowledge Base” of your web hosting company. Many have step-by-step instructions.

## Enable Maintenance Mode With A Plugin

Choose this option if you don’t like the Coming Soon page provided by your hosting company, or if you would like to have more control over how the page appears to your visitors. And maintenance mode plugins can provide other benefits like allowing visitors to sign up to be notified when the site is live or have a chatbot talk to visitors.

The plugin I use that offers these features is [LightStart - Maintenance Mode, Coming Soon and Landing Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-maintenance-mode/). It allows you to create a page telling visitors your site is down for maintenance or a custom Coming Soon page. And you still have access to the admin dashboard so you can configure your site and add content.

The plugin’s settings allows you to display a countdown on your site which is a great way to buy excitement from your visitors. Or you can create a subscription form so you can collect the contact details from your interested visitors so you can notify them when your site is live. Finally, you can enable the chatbot to “speak” with your visitors using a set script you can create. Or use the pre-defined template provided by the plugin.

# [Chapter 6: Find A WordPress Theme That Fits Your Industry](#chapter6)

One of the first moves you should make when you start customizing your website is choosing the WordPress theme that fits your industry.

This step is going to be a bunch of trial and error because you may find a theme that looks awesome in the demo but when you install it and start customizing the theme doesn’t look the way you though it would. Or the theme’s customizations are limited. This is especially true of free theme.

## Use Trusted Sources To Download WordPress Themes

Before we get started in this chapter I want to warn you about websites offering free downloads for WordPress themes. And there are websites offering popular non-free themes for sale at deep discounts. You should never download any themes from these sites because they may have tampered with the theme to include malware. And these sites are usually selling stolen licenses.

Thus, when you install a tampered theme your site will most likely become infected. This could give a hacker the ability to control your site or even steal your data. As for stolen licenses, you are in possession of stolen property which is illegal. Also, the theme installation files you get with the stolen license may or may not work properly. Or could harbor malware too.

So who can you trust when it comes to downloading themes? [The official WordPress website](https://wordpress.org/themes/).

A theme listed in their directory has been submitted to them and reviewed by their team using “Theme Unit Test data.” [Their review process is strict](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/) so bad actors trying to upload infected themes are not going to pass.

If you want a non-free theme then check out WordPress’ “Commercial Themes” [here](https://wordpress.org/themes/commercial/).

## Should You Buy A Theme?

There are thousands of free themes available for download on WordPress developed for various industries or for certain requirements. Yet, you will quickly discover that many of these free themes aren’t exactly “free.” These themes lock certain features and require you to purchase a yearly license to unlock them.

So should you buy a theme?

Buying a theme, sometimes marketed as a “Premium Theme,” can be a good investment of your money. Mostly because they are designed to make creating a website easier. And these themes have features to improve the appearance of your site. Also, by purchasing these themes you usually get priority technical support and get new updates for a limited time (usually six months or a year).

When I was working at a startup that developed and maintained WordPress websites for customers we used the [X theme](https://theme.co/x). It currently retails for $79 and our customers were happy to pay the price due to how well their sites looked.

So if you want to go this route I suggest you research the Premium Themes available on [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress) (also called Envato Market.) Yes, in the previous section I provided a link to the official WordPress Commercial Themes but Theme Forest is a legitimate company too. And they check all submitted themes for quality too.

You can filter themes based on a particular category (like Corporate, Ecommerce, Retail, etc.) and you can view themes sorted by price. The website is great because it shows you the weekly sales of each theme, along with its rating.

As for the prices, Premium themes will range in price from $20 to $80. Depending on the developer, you may purchase the theme through a yearly subscription or a one-time cost.

## How To Find A Theme That Fits Your Industry

If you are searching for themes on the [official WordPress website](https://wordpress.org/themes/) then you can search for themes in two ways:
* Search box
* Feature Filter

The search box allows you to search for themes using various terms. This avenue works best if you use specific search terms like “shop,” “retail,” or “restaurant.” Mostly because themes are usually named or titled with the industry or category designations.

The Feature Filter allows you to search for specific layouts, features, or subjects. For example: You only want to use a grid layout instead of columns and this filter will return themes fitting that layout. If you need certain features like accessibility, full width, or translation support then Feature Filter helps you find those themes. Finally, the subject filter will only show themes in particular categories like Ecommerce or food & drink.

Now, if you’re searching for themes on Theme Forest you only have access to a search box and browsing themes by category.

# [Chapter 7: Install These Plugins To Make Your Site Successful](#chapter7)

At this point your WordPress installation is installed, you’ve chosen your theme, and the default plugins are the only ones installed. In this chapter I’ll tell you which plugins to install to make your website successful.

## The Default Plugins Pre-Installed On Your Installation

You will find the following plugins probably installed when you browse your installation:
* Akismet: A spam detection and prevention plugin. This requires a non-free subscription to work properly.
* Jetpack: A security plugin that also provides backup, speed improvements, and marketing tools. Some features are non-free and require a subscription to work properly.
* A cache plugin: Depending on your web hosting company a cache plugin will probably be installed to improve the speed of your site. Sometimes you cannot uninstall these.

Should you deactivate and/or delete these plugins? It depends.

Akismet is a decent plugin if you have a comment section on your website as it will help block spam comments. Personally I don’t use it because I use a different comment system that has built-in spam protection.

As for Jetpack I like this plugin because it does provide various security and marketing features. I use it on my Ecommerce site because it monitors downtime, meaning if my site goes down for any reason Jetpack will send me an email. Finally, I like how several of these features are free.

Finally, if your web hosting company installs a cache plugin I would suggest you keep it installed. These help the speed and performance of your website which will keep your visitors happy and can help your SEO rankings.

## The Plugins You Should Install On Your Website

WordPress plugins falls into the following categories:
* Comments
* Contact Forms
* Ecommerce
* Marketing
* Page Builder
* Security
* SEO
* Website Analytics

Let’s discuss which plugins you should install from each category.

### Comments

The comment system built-into WordPress is very basic and doesn’t offer any spam protection. Also, its login system is simple and doesn’t allow for visitors to login with their social media account. If comments are going to be important to your site you need to replace the basic comment system with a plugin. Here are some popular choices:
* Disqus
* Jetpack
* wpDiscuz

**Disqus**

[Disqus](https://disqus.com/) is a popular comment system you’ve probably seen on many websites. However, the plugin has seen many changes throughout the years. While you can still use it to replace the built-in comment system now you can use it to review your site’s analytics and make money from your content.

While this plugin is free to download and use the free edition comes with basic functionality. And you will have to deal with ads which you may not want on your site. So if you want to remove the ads and get more features you will have to pay for it. While I’m fine with paying for plugins because many offer great benefits, Disqus is quite expensive. The “Plus” plan is $12 per month while the “Pro” plan is $115 a month!

I don’t use Disqus and it’s not a comment plugin I suggest to others. However, please do your due diligence to see if this plugin works for you. You may need the advanced moderation tools and custom reactions which the software offers.

**Jetpack**

[Jetpack Comments](https://jetpack.com/support/comments/) installs a new comment system that has social media logins. This allows your readers to leave a comment by using one of their social media accounts (WordPress.com, Twitter, Facebook, or Google).

Unlike Disqus this plugin is free to use and doesn’t have any paid upgrades. While I don’t use this comment system it appears to be a good solution if you want a free comment system with social media logins.

**wpDiscuz**

The final plugin is the one I use on my blogs and recommend to others: [wpDiscuz](https://wpdiscuz.com/). The developers state this is WordPress #1 comment plugin. It has large install base and is highly rated. In addition, it provides awesome user engagement features and looks pretty snazzy.

This plugin provides 100 core features for free however there are [extensions](https://wpdiscuz.com/extend-wpdiscuz/) you can buy to extend the software’s functionality. If you do go this route then I suggest you buy the bundle because you will save money.

### Contact Forms

You will need a contact form so your visitors and customers can ask you a question or get a quote. Here are some popular choices:
* Contact Form 7
* WPForms

**Contact Form 7**

I used [Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/) for years but no longer. It worked very well for me but like others I moved on from this plugin. Why? It has a learning curve and doesn’t have many features built-in. If you want to improve the plugin then you have to download additional plugins.

However, I still recommend this plugin because not only is it free it does handle basic forms well. Finally, the developer continues to keep the plugin updated.

**WPForms**

On the other end of the spectrum is [WPForms](https://wpforms.com/) which has over 100 templates. This is the plugin I use now. If you need a contact form this plugin most likely has a template for it. In addition, this software has a drag-and-drop builder that is easy to use.

The only downside to WPForms is the pricing. The “Basic” plan is $79 a year. If you want to integrate email marketing like Mailchimp or Sendinblue then you have to upgrade to the “Plus” plan which is $199.00 a year. Finally, if you want your forms to include a payment option like PayPal or Stripe then you have to buy the “Pro” plan which is $399.00 a year.

### Ecommerce

These plugins transform your basic WordPress website into a full-fledged online store. Here are some popular choices:
* Easy Digital Downloads
* MemberPress
* Shopify
* WooCommerce

**Easy Digital Downloads**

If you are building a website to sell digital products like music, ebooks, or software then [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) is a great choice for your website. You need a way for your customers to download their digital purchases and handle customers who want to redownload their purchases.

Now the plugin is free to download and use but you may want to invest in their “Pass” so you can use extensions to improve the plugin’s functionality. If you buy the extensions individually they are quite expensive. The passes range in cost from $99 to $499.

**MemberPress**

Your business may be one where you sell memberships and you want a website that allows easy facilitation for you and your customers. [MemberPress](https://memberpress.com/) is a popular choice which allows you to charge your customers to access your content and create/manage subscriptions.

This is a non-free plugin and you will have to buy a yearly subscription to access all of its features. The Basic plans starts at $279 and is probably the best choice upon starting out. You will get the ability to have unlimited members and courses as well as Stripe and PayPal integration.

**Shopify**

Already using Shopify but want to use it in WordPress too? Well you can do that through the [Shopify Buy Button](https://www.shopify.com/buy-button/wordpress). You can sell on your website without much setup for $9 a month. According to its website: “The Shopify Buy Button creates a standalone mini-storefront on your WordPress blog or website and connects directly with Shopify’s secure shopping cart platform. All you need is a product to sell and you’re ready to launch. And yes – it’s fully customizable to match your brand’s look.”

**WooCommerce**

For those wanting to build a full-fledged Ecommerce store using WordPress then [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) is the plugin for you. This is the plugin I use to run my store, [Let’s All Meat](letsallmeat.com). You can use this plugin to create just about any online store.

WooCommerce is free to download and it comes with the Storefront theme. However, like previous plugins, you will need to spend money to add more features you’ll probably need for your online store. If you want to use the Storefront theme then I highly suggest you invest in the [Storefront Extensions Bundle](https://woocommerce.com/products/storefront-extensions-bundle/). It is $69 but it allows you to customize the theme without any coding knowledge. However, you can purchase other themes that fit your industry.

### Marketing

You need to spend some time and energy marketing your website so you can bring in visitors and potential customers. The following plugins will help with that effort:
* Email Marketing Plugins
* Social Media Plugins

**Email Marketing Plugins**

This is a collection of plugins that depend on what email marketing service you use. It could be [Sendinblue](https://www.sendinblue.com/plugins/wordpress/), [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/integrations/wordpress/), [Newsletter](https://www.thenewsletterplugin.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/products/wordpress), or others.

Upon installing one of these plugins into your website you will gain the ability to track information about your visitors and/or customers, send out newsletters, or collect information for mailing lists.

**Social Media Plugins**

This is a collection of plugins for whatever social media platforms you use. You will find plugins for [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/881403525362441) or [Google](https://sitekit.withgoogle.com/) or a plugin that delivers your content to multiple platforms at once. That could be [Smash Balloon](https://smashballoon.com/) or [WordPress to Buffer](https://www.wpzinc.com/plugins/wordpress-to-buffer-pro/).

Finally, you need to install a plugin that allows your visitors or customer to share your page or post or product to their social media accounts. The Jetpack plugin can do this as well as [AddtoAny](https://www.addtoany.com/).

### Page Builder

These plugins allow you to customize WordPress’ layout easily, usually through drag-and-drop. Without these plugins you would need extensive coding knowledge. Here are some popular choices:
* Divi
* Elementor

**Divi**

[Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) brands itself as the “most popular WordPress theme in the world and the ultimate WordPress page builder.” This page builder plugin replaces the WordPress post editor with a visual editor, allowing you to drag-and-drop to create beautiful sites without programming experience. In addition, this plugin allows you to build responsive websites so your site will appear perfectly on mobile devices.

Divi isn’t cheap, however. If you choose the yearly subscription you’ll pay $89. However, you can choose the “Lifetime Access” option for $249. For the price you will get the Divi Theme Builder, WooCommerce Modules, hundreds of pre-built websites, and various marketing features.

**Elementor**

[Elementor](https://elementor.com/) is another popular page builder, which, like Divi, replaces the WordPress post editor with a visual editor. It also has drag-and-drop website building. And like the previous plugin it comes with marketing solutions and various built-in widgets and theme elements.

Elementor’s pricing is different than Divi as you will pay a license fee depending on the number of websites you want to build with it. The “Essential” plan is $49 per year and is for one website. However, if you decide to use this guide to start building websites for others then you will need to consider investing into the “Advanced” or “Expert” plans as you get licenses for three websites and twenty-five websites respectively.

### Security

I already covered how important security is for your web hosting account and your WordPress installation. Here I’ll discuss some popular plugin choices to help you secure your site:
* Jetpack
* Sucuri Website Application Firewall
* Wordfence

**Jetpack**

[Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/support/security-features/) has various security features built-in for free and others you have to purchase, such as downtime monitoring, brute force attack protection, and secure sign-on.

However, if you want the plugin to scan your website for any malware or have it backup your files then you have to subscribe to one of their plans. Frankly, there’s too many plans that Jetpack offers to list here so check out their website for a comparison.

**Sucuri Website Application Firewall**

[Sucuri Website Application Firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/) (WAF) is a plugin that does the following
* Instantly Block Hackers
* DDoS Mitigation and Prevention
* Virtual Patching and Hardening
* Protect Brand Reputation
* Prevent Zero-Day Exploits

This firewall protects your WordPress installation from bad actors and the pricing for this plugin is reasonable for the protection you’re buying. The “Basic” plan is $199.99 a year and the “Pro” plan which is 299.99 per year.

**Wordfence**

[Wordfence](https://www.wordfence.com/) is a WAF like Sucuri and protects your site from malware. Unlike Sucuri, Wordfence runs on your server not in the cloud because the former provides better protection. Mostly because Cloud firewalls can be bypassed. In addition to those features, Wordfence will check your WordPress core files, themes, and plugins for malware.

This is the plugin I use on all my websites. It does have a free version which provides all the benefits of the “Premium” version except the real-time features (like firewall rule updates and IP Blocklist). I bought the “Premium” version for my online store and one license runs for $119. If you buy more licenses you get better discounts, or if you buy a multi-year license you also get a discount.

### SEO

You need to work on getting your website listed in search engines and there’s a very popular plugin that will do just that:
* Yoast SEO

[Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/) is the plugin I use on all my sites. It helps you not only develop excerpts of your blog posts so they show up properly in search engine results, but Yoast SEO also provides suggestions on how to properly format your posts to grab readers’ attention.

The company also provides an extensive learning section where you can learn all about SEO. Although this plugin is free to use there is a premium version that offers more benefits. I haven’t invested in this version because the free edition provides all the SEO functions I need.

### Website Analytics

You need to verify that people are actually visiting your website, and determine what actions they take on your site. Here are some popular choice:
* ExactMetrics
* GA Google Analytics
* Jetpack
* MonsterInsights

**ExactMetrics**

[ExactMetrics](https://www.exactmetrics.com/) is a premium, advanced Google Analytics plugin that’s easy to set up and provides a dashboard so you can read your stats without going to Google Analytics. The plugin also tracks Ecommerce (by integrating with WooCommerce) and you can do A/B testing with Google Optimize.

As for pricing you can tell it’s going to be pricey when the brand states it’s premium. The starting plan, “Plus,” runs $199.00 a year. However, if you need Ecommerce support or want to track more websites then you have to upgrade to the “Pro” plan for $399.00 a year.

**GA Google Analytics**

[GA Google Analytics](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ga-google-analytics/#description) is a free plugin that allows you to add your Google Analytics code into your website. You can use an Universal Analytics (UA) tag or a Global Site Tag. And it supports Google Analytics 4.

I use this plugin on my sites because it offers all the features I want and I don’t mind visiting Google Analytics to view my stats. So if you’re basic like me then this plugin could work very well for you.

**Jetpack**

Jetpack provides site stats for free. And you only have to click one button to enable it. The dashboard for the site stats are pretty simple as you can view the number of hits your site got daily, popular times, geographic locations, and search terms. Finally, this part of the plugin also informs you what your popular blog posts are.

While this feature is nice I would suggest to use Google Analytics instead because you will get more in-depth information about your website visitors.

**MonsterInsights**

[MonsterInsights](https://www.monsterinsights.com/) states it’s the “best WordPress analytics plugin” and it does have a huge install base of over 3 million. Just like ExactMetrics you will get a dashboard that shows your stats without having you to visit the Google Analytics website. The plugin also provides real-time stats, Ecommerce tracking, affiliate link tracking, and much more.

Again, like ExactMetrics, you’re going to have to pay for these features. The “Plus” plan costs $199.00 and provides many standard features most website owners will need. You can upgrade to the “Plus” plan for $399.00 for advanced features (like Ecommerce support) and to get additional licenses.
