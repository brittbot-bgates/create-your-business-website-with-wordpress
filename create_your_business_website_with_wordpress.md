## About The Author

Hello, my name is Brittany Gates and I’m a data center aficionado and creative writer. I’ve worked in the IT Industry for fifteen years now. By day I work in a data center for a Silicon Valley company and by night I write. Oh, and I also run a few websites built with WordPress.

My history with WordPress is over a decade old now. I started using it around 2007, and over the years I’ve watched the software improve not only in features but also in its appearance and security.

This guide allows me to use all my skills as I’m going to teach you how to create a WordPress website for your business. This won't be short nor easy process because building a website is time-consuming and difficult at certain points. Which is why so many business owners hire a company or an agency. 

## Why WordPress?

You’re probably wondering why I choose WordPress to build my websites. And why I recommend it to everyone who ask me what software or framework to use to create a website. Especially when there are are cloud-based services like Wix and Squarespace. Well, it’s because I love WordPress and open source software. As the tagline states on WordPress' website: "Create a place for your business, your interests, or anything else—with the open source platform that powers the web[wordpress.org](wordpress.org).”

Also, its mission is simple: It is designed for everyone, is open-source, and is welcoming and inclusive. Thus, anyone can share their thoughts, feelings, or create a business with WordPress.

WordPress was created in 2003 by Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg and is operated by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). While WordPress was originally created for blogging you can use it now to create various types of websites. And this versatility makes it a great choice for businesses.

It’s also a Content Management System [CMS](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/). This system allows you to not only create digital content (like blog posts, music files, videos, etc.) but modify them. Also, WordPress can also be considered a Web Content Management (WCM) system because it provides the ability for individuals to create and/or add images, photos, music, videos, and much more.

CMS is broken up into two parts:
* Content Management Application (CMA) 
* Content Delivery Application (CDA) 

The CMA allows inexperienced users to create, update, or delete content from a website without the aid of experienced professional. Years ago you would have to hire a Webmaster or a Web Developer for this type of work.

The CDA does all the heavy lifting in the background because it takes all the pictures, text, and other information you supplied and puts it all together. Thus, it creates everything you see on the website. Finally, the CDA has the job of updating the website.

WordPress is not only the only CMS used to build websites, and its competitors are Drupal, Joomla, and ModX. However, WordPress has the most market share out of all these systems. At the time of publication 42% of the Web uses WordPress.

I wrote quite a bit to convince you but now I want to discuss some of WordPress’ benefits in more detail.

## Its Popularity Created A Vast Ecosystem

I already discussed the large market share WordPress has for website creation. And due to that popularity other developers created a vast ecosystem over time to extend the capabilities of the software. These individuals created thousands of free and non-free themes and plugins for the public to use. These themes and plugins allow WordPress to be transformed into a retail online store or a membership website. Because these developers saw successful from their labors they are fully invested in improving WordPress.

I will go into more detail about these themes and plugins later on in the guide. And I’ll tell you which ones are critical to the success of your site, and others that are good to have because they provide additional features.

## One-Click Auto-Install Makes Installation A Breeze

When I started using WordPress back in 2007 the installation was difficult, to say the least. I followed the “Basic Instructions” posted here. If you didn’t follow these instructions or weren’t tech savvy you would run into issues. It was common to install the software improperly or connect your database incorrectly. And many people, myself included, edited their core WordPress files incorrectly, causing their sites to crash.

Yet, with “Automated Installation” (also called one-click installation) normal now with various web hosting companies, beginners can install WordPress within minutes by filling in a few details. As a result of this, I can get installations up and running in a quick manner. This is fantastic when I need to spin up a site for testing.

## The WordPress UI Is Intuitive

WordPress’ User Interface (UI) is intuitive now. The side menu has all of the functions you need, such as “Posts” and “Media,” right there so you don’t have to search for them. In addition, each function’s name tells you what it exactly does. “Posts” allow you to create a blog post. “Pages” is when you want to create a page on your site. “Media” contains pictures, videos, music, and other media.

## Enhanced Blogging & Content Creation Capabilities

WordPress is still the best CMS to use for blog creation. Yes, there sites like Medium and Tumblr, but those sites don’t offer the plugins or configurations this software offers.

Even though you can create websites with WordPress, its focus was and is blogging. And that’s improved drastically over the years. Writing posts is a breeze! I can add animated GIFs with a few clicks. When I want to slip in headings and sub-headings those are also just a few clicks of your mouse or trackpad. Finally, when I want to add a “Featured Image” (the image that shows up above the blog post) or an image within the body of my text, I can upload one and then insert it in under a minute.

Finally, if you need to share files (like documents) WordPress allows for that too. All you have to do is upload the files using their software and add them to your site with a few clicks of your mouse or trackpad.

## WordPress Block Editor Works Well Now

WordPress made it very simple to create blog posts and pages with the new WordPress Editor / Gutenberg update in 2018. However, this update divided users during its beta because it introduced major changes on how to create and edit content. And when new editor became the default in WordPress users were highly upset. However, you can re-enable the Classic Editor via a plugin if you so choose. As for me, I really enjoy using the Block Editor. It simplifies the addition of text, headings, images, video, and now even podcasts into your blog posts and/or pages.

# [Chapter 1: Purchase A Domain Name & Web Hosting](#chapter1)

In this step I discuss what a domain name is, how to buy one, and how to choose the proper web hosting provider for your website. This step, in my opinion, is the most important part of your website because you must choose a domain name that is not only easy to remember but is not too long. In addition, the web hosting company you choose can make or break the performance of your site.

I highly recommend you do not skimp on the costs when it comes to choosing a good domain name or web hosting. Although I don’t want you to choose the most expensive domain name or hosting plan either, I just stress that if you go the cheap route you will get what you pay for. Either your hosting plan will have slower performance, or you won’t have enough storage for your files, or the web hosting company will have subpar customer service. And if you find yourself in this situation then you will have to spend more money to resolve the issue. (Except bad customer service as you usually can’t buy a better version of it.)

## How To Buy A Domain Name For Your Business

### What Is A Domain Name?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name): “A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet.”

Here are some examples of domain names:
* amazon.com
* ebay.com
* newegg.com

### Create An Original Name

A problem that individuals or businesses run into when it comes to their domain name is they create one that’s too similar to another company. Sometimes these names mimic ones held by popular companies which can cause problems. 
One problem is the public could confuse the new business’ domain name with the popular company. Thus, this could cause brand issues.

The second problem, which could lead to legal issues, is when an individual or business register a domain name that’s almost exactly the same as another company. Here’s an example of that:

Let’s say you decide to register the domain name goog.com. This name is too similar to google.com. And this name could confuse some of Google’s customers to think your website and/or business is related to Google’s products and services. Because of this Google decides to send their Legal team after you because you’re infringing on their trademark and/or brand. And they have done so in the past. [Google sued the owner(s) behind oogle.com in 2012](https://dnattorney.com/google-loses-oogle-com-domain-name-dispute/).

If you think that domain names can’t get a trademark [Nolo discusses how these can](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/domain-names-trademarks-faq.html). If you would like to learn more about this so you and your business don’t run afoul of infringing on another company’s trademark, [Donut](https://www.lawdonut.co.uk/business/contracts-disputes/ip-disputes/domain-name-disputes-faqs) has a great FAQ section about this topic. Also, The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has a [page](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en) devoted to this too. This group coordinates the domain names, among other things, of the Internet.

To create an original name you can use your name and the industry you work in. This works pretty well if you sell services. Let’s say your name is Robert Johnson and you run a HVAC company. You could create a domain name like “johnsonhvac.com” or rjohnsonhvac.com” or johnsonheatingandair.com.”

However, if you operate a business selling goods then you may want to create an original name along whatever goods you’re selling. Let’s say you sell health and beauty products using organic coconut oil. You could create a domain name based around your product line name.

### Use Business Name Generator To Create A Domain Name 
A great way to create an original domain name if you’re having trouble creating one is to use a business name generator. In doing so you will get a list of business names by entering words suited to your business and/or industry.

Using [BusinessNameGenerator](https://businessnamegenerator.com/), let’s look at the names I get when I enter the following for specific industries:

Education
* Educatdo 
* Totorhut 
* Teachingly

Fitness 
* Fitnetic 
* Fitfluent 
* Workoutpad 

Food & Drink 
* Smack Burgers 
* Barscape 
* Winesy

Music 
* Musadora 
* Musdeck 
* Beatsable 

Retail 
* Clothinglux 
* Fashnest 
* Decorverse

Some of these names were available for purchase while others were already taken. Your results will be different but this is a good option to try.

### When To Buy Your Domain Name

If you are sitting around one day, or standing in line somewhere, or have a dream and the idea of a particular domain name hits you then you need to buy it. Only because these ideas usually don’t come around again.

When you are working toward opening a business then you need to buy your domain name ahead of time. I bought the domain name for my upcoming ecommerce store, [letsallmeat.com](letsallmeat.com), long before I even thought of opening the business.

Yes, there’s the possibility you could change your business name after you bought the domain name. Which is why I suggest to register your domain name for one year when you first start. Domain names aren’t that expensive, and range in price from $8 to $50, depending on the registrar and the Top Level Domain (TLD) chosen. So if you happen to not use that domain in favor of another one then you’re not out that much money.

### How Long To Buy Your Domain Name

When it comes to the length of how long you purchase your domain name the default is 1 year. However, many domain registrars allow you to add years for an additional cost.

The benefit of this is to: 
1. Save money 
2. Less likely to forget to renew your name. 

Yep, once you buy a domain name you have to renew it every year. It’s like car registration. 

I used to only buy 1 year terms for my domain names but I’ve recently switched to multi-year terms because the cost savings are better. Yet, it’s fine if you decide to buy only one year plans. 

Finally, I have my domain names set to auto-renew and keep a valid credit card on file. I still get an email from my domain registrar stating it’s time to renew my name, but if I miss that email then I don’t have to worry about forgetting to renew my name. 

What happens if you don’t renew? First, your website stops working because it’s no longer connected to the name. That’s because your domain registrar will move the name back into the pool of availability for others to purchase. And if someone else buys it then you have to buy it from them (if you can). 

### Choose A Generic Top-Level Domain 

Before you search to see if a potential domain name is available, you first must decide which [generic top-level domain (TLD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain) you will use. Here’s a short list of generic TLDs currently available from various domain registrars:
* .com 
* .net 
* .org 
* .dev 
* .app 
* .inc 
* .website 

Most people choose the .com TLD because it’s the most popular. Due to that, sometimes it’s difficult to use a specific name for your website because it’s already taken. If that happens and you really want the name it could be for sale. You will know if you see a “Make Offer” or something similar button. This will start the process of offering to buy the domain name but be warned: You may have to spend a massive amount of money to do so.

### Should You Buy Multiple / All TLDs For Your Chosen Name?

You finally bought your domain name for your websites, let’s use example.com for this scenario. The domain registrar shows you various other TLDs available for your name. Now you’re wondering should you buy example.net and example.org and example.dev because you want to protect your trademark and/or your brand. Should you do that? Is that a great idea?
 
Google, and other major companies, do this because if they waited to buy the other TLDs later someone else could buy that TLDs. People do this because they’re hoping you’ll want to buy it later and they can sell it for a nice profit. This is called [Cybersquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting) (also called Domain Squatting) and there are laws about this in America and in some countries.

Finally, I highly suggest you don’t buy some non-popular TLDs like example.golf or recently launched TLDs. Mostly because they don’t have the name recognition like a .com or a .net.

### When To Purchase A Premium Domain Name

During your search you are bound to come across a Premium domain name. What are those? According to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/) Premium domain names “are short domains, often made up of just one word or 3-5 letters. They are also known as ‘aftermarket’ or ‘pre-registered’ domains.” Good examples of these types of names: 
* google.com 
* facebook.com 
* aarp.com

These names are catchy and short, which is gold when it comes to marketing. That’s why I suggest you consider one if you can 1) afford it and 2) it will advertise your brand very well. [Namecheap wrote a blog post](https://www.namecheap.com/blog/pay-big-bucks-aftermarket-domains/) about several companies spending $10,000+ for their premium domain names. While this price tag is expensive for many individuals and/or companies, you can look at the investment as part of building your brand.

### Always Choose WhoisGuard

When you buy a domain name from a domain registrar always elect to enable [WhoisGuard](http://www.whoisguard.com/). Even if the option cost additional money. Why? And what does it do? According to their website: “WhoisGuard avoids this issues by placing our information in whois and provides an option to redirect email and regular mail to the customer’s real address. During the process of transferring the email, we try to avoid obvious junk email and regular mail, thus relieving the customer from junk.”

When you buy a domain name, you have to input the name of owner, the address of the company, and a phone number. That information is publicly available, meaning spammers or stalkers or anyone could call you, spam you, or just bother you. And if you are buying a domain name for personal use or running a home-based business, your personal information would be available too. You don’t want that.

### The Domain Registrar I Recommend

When it comes to buying a domain name I only use [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I’ve used them for 16 years (as of the publication of this book) and always get great support from them. And they offer WhoisGuard for free forever.

I also buy other products from them, like SSL certs (which I’ll discuss later in this guide) and web hosting for my WordPress sites.

Finally, Namecheap has very good prices when it comes to domain names. You can get a .com TLD for $8.88 a year! And if you catch one of their sales (which is often) you can get a .com TLD cheaper than that.

## How To Choose The Proper Web Hosting Provider For Your Website 

In this section I’ll give you tips on how to buy the proper web hosting provider for your website. There’s some many providers to choose from and sometimes you can’t go by reviews alone. 

I’ll also compare Managed versus Shared web hosting, which are two of the most popular options and are inexpensive to buy. In that comparison I’ll show the pros and cons of each, and then give my final recommend on which type you should use for your site. 

### What Is Web Hosting? 
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service): “A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center.”

Web hosting companies have servers in a [data center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center) and then rent those for customer use. What are [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))? Think of them as bigger and more power computers. Servers have higher-end CPUs, more memory, larger capacity storage disks, and high-bandwidth network ports to allow multiple users access it at once to get the information they need. 

When you purchase a web hosting package, the company takes one of the servers they own and prepares a portion of it for you to use. 

There are different types of web hosting packages: 
* Managed hosting 
* Shared hosting 
* Virtual Private Server (VPS) 
* Dedicated servers 

In this guide I’m not going to discuss VPS or Dedicated servers because those are usually geared toward high-traffic websites, or experienced owners who want complete control over their server. And these options are the most expensive web hosting packages. 

### Managed Hosting 

This hosting is usually the cheapest package you can buy. It is sometimes advertised as “WordPress Hosting.” It is inexpensive because the web hosting company controls the entire server. You, the tenant on the server, has no control over the operating system used on the server or the software running it. However, you don’t have to do any maintenance on it either. 

Let’s look at the pros and cons: 

**Pros:** 
* Very inexpensive price plans. 
* Great for personal blogs or small websites / businesses. 
* The web hosting company performs all the updates to the servers, including WordPress core updates (not plugins, however). 

**Cons:** 
* The servers offered usually have lower technical specifications, so if your website grows significantly your performance can suffer. 
* You do not have access to the back-end applications so you may not have access to cPanel. 
* If you need SFTP or database access, you may or may not have access to it. If you do have access to it you may have to go through a process to enable it. 

### Shared Hosting 

This hosting is more expensive than managed hosting because you will get more access to certain back-end applications. And these packages offer more CPUs, storage space, and memory. Just like with Managed Hosting the hosting company controls the server and you as the tenant have no control over the operating system or the software running on it. 

**Pros:** 
* Affordable prices plans. 
* Great for small & medium business websites. 
* The web hosting company performs all the updates to the servers, including software update (probably not WordPress core updates, however). 
* You have access to cPanel, SFTP, and database access. 
* Some companies offer a website builder program. 

**Cons:** 
* The cheapest plans can have sparse features, meaning you will have to spend more if you need additional features. 
* Some companies offer free services with a chosen plan (like domain name or SSL certificates), but those services become non-free after a period of time. 

### Which Hosting Is Right For Your Business Website? 

If you want to build a small business website and don’t want to handle any of the updates (except WordPress updates), then I recommend you purchase Managed Hosting. If your site grows larger and you need more storage space or memory then you can purchase Shared Hosting and transfer everything over. 

However, if you want to run an ecommerce website or your business provides web applications then choose Shared Hosting. Due to the improve servers your sites will perform better. You can’t have a slow website because that will drive your visitors and customers away. 

### The Web Hosting Company I Recommend (And Use) 

When it comes to Managed Hosting I use and recommend [EasyWP](https://www.easywp.com/) by Namecheap. You can start for free for 30 days and there isn’t a commitment if the service doesn’t work out for you. 

There are three packages to choose from: 
* Starter 
* Turbo 
* Supersonic 

If you are just starting out and don’t think your business website will be popular at first then you can begin with the Starter package. However, it may be better to choose the Turbo package because you get more storage space along with more CPUs and memory. Supersonic is great for businesses that require constant uptime along with more storage, CPU, and memory. 

Here are a few features of EasyWP: 
* Hosted on Namecheap Cloud 
* Support for any domain name provider: You can buy your domain name from any domain registrar. 
* Easy-to-use dashboard to manage WordPress websites: You don’t have to spend much time trying to find the information you need. 
* Safe and secure 
* Easy backups and restores 
* SFTP and database access: These allow you to not only transfer files to and from your site, but you can modify or update your database. 

As for Shared Hosting I also use and recommend Namecheap. There are three packages to choose from: 
* Stellar 
* Stellar Plus 
* Stellar Business 

I use Stellar Business for my ecommerce site because it’s the only PCI-compatible hosting package out of the collection. And this package provides not only auto-backups but cloud storage (which promises 100% uptime along with stability and data protection). 

Here are a few features of Shared Hosting: 
* Unmetered bandwidth: You can have as much traffic coming and going to and from your website. 
* Free domain name and privacy protection: You can register your domain name for free for the first year. 
* Free automatic SSL installation: Get a free SSL certificate for the first year. 
* Free in <24 hours website migration: If you have a website hosted somewhere else you can transfer it to Namecheap and have it up and running under 24 hours. 

This hosting package also works well with WordPress if you don’t want to go the EasyWP route, or if that hosting doesn’t fit your business needs. With Namecheap’s Shared Hosting you can install WordPress with one-click and do all its administrative tasks through [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/). Finally, you will get an email service which allows you to create email accounts and build mailing lists. 

The final reason why I use and recommend Namecheap is their customer service. While you may find other web hosting companies offering cheaper packages their customer service can be lackluster. And when you have an issue with your site or if you have a crucial question you need top-notch service. Every time I’ve contacted Namecheap’s customer service I’ve gotten prompt replies to my questions. Yeah, sometimes I had to wait for several minutes but that’s normal. As for my issues that required additional technical support they were resolved within 24 to 48 hours. 

### Should You Consider Using WordPress.com? 

This guide focuses on you building a website using self-hosted WordPress. However, there is wordpress.com which is Automattic’s solution for those who want to use WordPress but not handle the software’s maintenance. And you don’t have to worry about choosing a web hosting company or need website design knowledge. 
Here are the pros and cons of wordpress.com: 

**Pros:** 
* You don’t have to perform any website maintenance as it’s handled by the company. 
* Very simple website creation through the use of themes and blocks. 
* Thousands of free plugins available. 
* Marketing tools like Mailchimp or website analytics tools like Google Analytics are built-in. 
* You can update your website on your smartphone via the WordPress app. 
* Free SSL certificate installed so your site is secure. 

**Cons:** 
* Their plans are more expensive than many Managed and Shared Hosting packages offered by other companies. 
* To get the additional features, you must pay for them. 
* If you require priority support, you must choose the more expensive plans. 
* You can’t remove the WordPress.com branding without paying for more expensive plans. 

Should choose wordpress.com to build your business website? Yes if you want any of the following: 
* If you need website that just works. 
* You want to run an ecommerce store and need technical support. 
* If you don’t feel comfortable with website design or don’t have the time to learn it. 

Now if you go this route prepare to pay more than you would for self-hosted WordPress. Although wordpress.com has a free package you’re not going to get much in terms of features. You will soon find out you’ll need to upgrade to one of the paid packages which can be quite expensive per month. And if you choose the “pay monthly” option you won’t get the free domain name for a year. 

### Should You Use WordPress’ Recommended Hosting Partners? 
If you don’t go with my web hosting provider recommendation you’ll need to find another. However, there’s so many providers to choose from you’re going to look for reviews online. One place you may look at first is WordPress’ website because they have a section all about hosting. They recommend the following web hosts: 
* Bluehost 
* DreamHost 
* SiteGround. 

In my opinion, Bluehost is expensive, DreamHost is the best economical choice, and SiteGround is also affordable but their plans' features can be scant when compared to DreamHost. Out of the three I would choose DreamHost.

# [Chapter 2: Install The Proper SSL Certificate](#chapter2)

After visiting dozens of small business websites for a project I worked on this past year I discovered too many of them do not use SSL certificates on their website, or only parts of them. The sites that did the latter only secured their sign-in pages and/or their cart/checkout page. Although this is fine, your entire website needs protection.

## What Is An SSL Certificate?

A Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Certificate encrypts traffic, transforming it from HTTP (unsecured) to HTTPS (secured). Also, this certificate protects information, especially sensitive material (like credit card numbers or protected health information) from bad actors, like hackers.

This certificate protects your website from these bad actors through [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). Think of this protection as your house address. This is public information and anyone can come to your house. Thus, your public key. However, there is a lock on your door which keeps those individuals from entering your house. Only you can enter your house with the proper key. Hence, your private key.

When you buy a certificate to secure your website, you have to create a public and private key. Then when your website transmits data one part of the transmission is encrypted with the public key, and the other part is decrypted with the private key.

This only a quick overview. If you would like to learn more about SSL certificates please view this website [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/).

## Why You Need SSL Certificates For Your Entire Website

Your entire website needs a SSL certificate because it affects your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) rankings. Google takes web security seriously and gives websites with better security higher rankings in their searches over non-secured websites. [Neil Patel did an extensive write-up on his website showing the data proving Google favors websites employing entire website security](https://neilpatel.com/blog/does-a-ssl-certificate-affect-your-seo-a-data-driven-answer/).

Also, having a SSL certificate installed for your entire website puts your visitors’ minds at ease. If someone visits your website and sees the homepage isn’t secure, and they can see that from the browser bar easily, then that visitor may be less likely to order your product or service. I know I would.

## SSL Certificates Are Inexpensive And Provide Good ROI

[You can get SSL certificates for free](https://letsencrypt.org/) or you can buy them for a fair price. I buy my SSL certificates from Namecheap and I recommend them.

Even if you have a buy an expensive certificate they provide a good return on investment. The ones I get through Comodo provide warranties. Meaning if the company fails to properly validate my certificate during the course of business, and that leads to loss or money or business, then I can submit a warranty claim for compensation. Namecheap explains more in [their article](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/885/38/ssl-certificate-warranty/).

Finally, when a visitor sees your website is secure, it makes them feel good, and can lead to them spending money on your goods and/or services.

## The Types Of SSL Certificates Available For Purchase

There are three types of SSL certificates you can purchase for your website:
* Domain Validated (DV)
* Organization Validated (OV)
* Extended Validation (EV)

While each certificate provides the same type of encryption, they differ on how the security companies verify the organization before they issue the certificate.

Domain Validated has the least checks done as the security organization only checks if the owner has the right to use a specific domain name. This is usually done by having the owner add a specific Domain Name System (DNS) entry through their web hosting company. The security company doesn’t check to make sure the owner is the actual owner, or says who he/she says he/she is.

The reason DV certificates are used because they are inexpensive, good for personal use like blogs, and they are issued almost instantly.

As for Organization Validated certificates the security company checks that the owner has the right to use the domain name and vets some of the information about the organization or business. And that information is displayed to visitors when they check the security icon in their browser. This gives visitors a better since of security as to who their private information is going to.

Unlike DV certificates, OV ones take more time to be issued because the security company has to vet the applicant.

Finally, Extended Validation certificates acts just like the OV but the security company vets the owner thoroughly. They check the legal, physical, and operational existence of the business. Then they verify that the identity matches those on official records. Finally the security company verify that the owner or organization initiated the certificate issuance.

# Which One Should You Pick For Your Business Website?

For personal websites like blogs I would go with a DV as it’s inexpensive (or free if you choose to use Let's Encrypt). That’s what I use for my blogs and other websites that don’t have a login portal for customers.

If you are building an ecommerce website I highly suggest you choose either a OV or EV certificate. Although these will cost more and require you to submit documentation regarding the ownership of your business, they can build higher trust within your visitors upon landing on your site. Also, these certificates provide higher warranties. Depending on where you purchase your SSL certificates warranties range from $100,000 to over $1,000,000.

For my ecommerce store I went with an OV certificate. Although I had to submit a form online about my business so the security company could validate it the process wasn’t difficult. You just have to make sure your business or organization is registered in some well-known databases beforehand. If you don’t, it will delay the issuance of your certificate.

Finally, if you’re building a website that will have a login portal for customers you also want to invest in a OV or EV certificate. Again, you need to encrypt customer’s sensitive data, like login credentials, so bad actors can’t grab them.

## Where Can You Buy SSL Certificates?

You can purchase SSL certificates from your web hosting company, but you can also purchase them directly from security companies. I highly suggest the former option because it makes installing the certificate easier. And you’ll probably get the best price.

I use and recommend Namecheap because their prices are fair. And you will save a good amount of money if you purchase a multi-year certificate.

If you don’t want to go through your web hosting company or my recommendation then you can buy certificates from the following:
* [ComodoCA](https://ssl.comodo.com/)
* [GlobalSign](https://shop.globalsign.com/en/ssl-tls-certificates)
* [Digicert](https://www.digicert.com/)
* [Sectigo](https://sectigo.com/products)

Warning: You may not get the best prices by buying the certificates directly from these companies. And you will be on your own installing it onto your website. Your web hosting company may have instructions how to do that or may not. Thus, you may have to ask the certification provider for installation instructions.

## Can You Use Let’s Encrypt Certificates?

Your web hosting company may offer free Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates and you may want to use these instead. While you can use these certificates they should only be used on personal sites (like blogs).

Why? Here’s [the group’s explanation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/faq/#what-services-does-let-s-encrypt-offer) about the certificates they issue: “Let’s Encrypt is a global Certificate Authority (CA). We let people and organizations around the world obtain, renew, and manage SSL/TLS certificates. Our certificates can be used by websites to enable secure HTTPS connections. Let’s Encrypt offers Domain Validation (DV) certificates. We do not offer Organization Validation (OV) or Extended Validation (EV) primarily because we cannot automate issuance for those types of certificates.”

# [Chapter 3: Secure Your WordPress Installation](#chapter3)

All day everyday individuals attack your website. And not only your website but also your hosting provider. Who are these people? Usually [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker), [crackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker#Cracker), scammers, or [script kiddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie). So how can you keep them out of your website and protect your WordPress installation. I give you several options and some tools to combat these bad actors while protecting your website.

## Start At Your Web Hosting Provider

The first place you should start when it comes to protecting your website is securing your web hosting account. If a bad actor gets control over it, they can delete your website or hold it ransom. Others could use your account to buy additional hosting space to send spam mail or run attacks against others, like a [DDoS attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/).

So how do you secure your web hosting account?

First, you need to use an original password. If you a reused password, meaning one you used for another website, stop reading now and change the password immediately! Hackers have access to password lists from previous breaches. They try these credentials at other websites to see if they are reused. [Unfortunately, they are](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/reusing-passwords/).

A great way to develop an original password is to use a password manager. I use [1Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) now to not only save and manager my passwords, but to generate new secure passwords.

Next, you need to enable [two-factor authentication](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-and-why-to-use-two-factor-authentication/) (2FA) on your account. This adds another layer of protection even if a hacker gets your password because 2FA requires a code or phrase. And this code or phrase changes constantly. Depending on your web hosting company, you can use one of the following 2FA methods:
* SMS text message
* Authentication program (Authy or Google Authenticator)
* Keyfob/security key

SMS text message is basic protection that can be intercepted by bad actors. Authentication programs like Authy is much better, however this can be defeated too if a hacker performs a [SIM-swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam). Yet, this can be uncommon as it takes quite a bit of work by a bad actor to perform a successful SIM-swap. The best protection is a keyfob (also called a security key). Your web hosting provider may or may not allow this type of 2FA so please check with them before buying a keyfob. If they do and need suggestions about which one to get, [The Verge wrote a good article comparing the various ones](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f).

Finally, only allow certain individuals access to your web hosting account if you work with a team of people. And each user should have their own password. Do not allow multiple people to use one account.

The first reason behind this is you can’t tell who accessed the account. So if there is a security incident you can’t determine which individual did it. The second reason is if one user account gets hacked you can sign into another to lock out the hacked user account.

## Securing Your WordPress Admin Account

Securing your WordPress administrative account is key. If a hacker or scammer is able to take control over this account, again they can delete your website or deface it or hold it for ransom.

So how can you secure it?

Just like with your web hosting account, use an original password for the WordPress admin account. Next, enable 2FA on that account. With self-hosted WordPress, you will have to use a security plugin like [WordFence](https://www.wordfence.com/) to do so.

Also consider changing the login URL. It’s widely known to add “/wp-admin/” or “wp-login.php” to the end of URL to access the WP login page. From there, hackers can try to login using the default username and password. The best way to change your login URL is to use a plugin. [Change wp-admin login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/change-wp-admin-login/) is a good choice and the one I use.

Speaking of the default username, WordPress provides “admin” which you shouldn’t accept. Type in a different username. However, if you use “admin” you can change it by following the instructions on [this site](https://themeisle.com/blog/change-wordpress-usernames/).

## WordPress Admin Usernames To Avoid

When you’re configuring your WordPress installation you’ll be asked to provide an admin username. Do not use any of the following as your username:
* admin
* demo
* test
* login
* editor

These are well-known usernames by hackers so they try these names first.

## How To Create A Good WordPress Admin Username

I know some people who use password generators to create a random string of characters and use that as an username. This is very secure yet it’s hard to remember. Plus, if you are managing multiple WordPress sites, choosing this option can make administration more difficult.

Other people use their first name or a combination of their first and last name as their admin username. While this is a fine strategy, people can still guess it if your name is associated with the website. I use my name on my personal website. Thus, I don’t use any part of my name in my admin username.

Finally, I know people who use nicknames as their WordPress admin username because it’s easy to remember. This can work if people don’t know that individual goes by a nickname.

## Enable Notifications And/Or Alerts For Different Methods

I highly suggest when it comes to protecting your website you must enable notifications and/or alerts for whenever a person logs in correctly or incorrectly. This way you know immediately when someone logged into the web hosting company or the WordPress administrative account.

Also, you should send these alerts through different methods, such as email and text message. That way if a hacker gets control of your website and your email, you still can get notifications through another avenue.

I use WordFence Security for my websites and I get emails whenever someone successfully and unsuccessfully logs in. The same happens whenever I login or make any change or order through my web hosting company.

How to set this up is going to depend on your hosting company. Review their “Knowledge Base” or “Help” section for assistance.

# [Chapter 4: How To Setup A WordPress Development Environment](#chapter4)

In this chapter I will teach you how to setup a WordPress development environment. This is crucial when it comes to building your website so the public will not see your work in progress. Also, you need a development environment so you can test out major updates in the future.

This environment can be remote (on a server on the Internet) or local (using software installed on your computer). For this guide I’m going to focus on installing a local development system on your computer due to its ease and doesn’t require an Internet connection.

You can use the following tools to create a local development system:
* Local by Flywheel
* MAMP

## Local by Flywheel

[Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) works on Windows, Mac, and Linux (Debian versions). It is free to use but you do have to sign up to use it.

You’re probably wondering how this software is free with all of the features it offers. Well, the company behind it, Flywheel, sells managed WordPress hosting. Thus, they are hoping that once you use their free product you will then pay the money to transfer your site onto one of their hosting plans. Unfortunately, their plans are quite expensive. The “Tiny” plan is $150 a year and you get scant storage space and bandwidth for that price.

Once you open the software you will create a project and then go through the motions to install WordPress and go through the setup as you normally would on your web hosting company. Upon setup’s completion you will have access to the admin dashboard and can begin customizing your site by choosing a theme, installing plugins, and adding content.

From here, you can view what your website looks like and make tweaks as needed.

## MAMP

[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) is free software you can install on Windows or [Mac](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/?m=1629109578&) but you don’t have to sign up to use it. It works pretty much like Local by Flywheel, however the User Interface is different.

There is a non-free professional edition of this software called MAMP PRO. The biggest reason to buy this version is if you need the ability to create separate hosts for each of your projects. If you require that functionality then [please check out their pricing](https://www.mamp.info/en/store/?m=1629117968&).

# [Chapter 5: How To Build Your Site And Hide It From Visitors](#chapter5)

In this section I will tell you how to build your website directly on the storage space you bought from your web hosting company and hide it from visitors. You can choose this option if you don’t want to setup a local development environment on your computer. I choose this option because I rather test my site on the actual hardware it’s going to be running on constantly instead of my computer.

## Enable Maintenance Mode Through Your Web Hosting Provider

Many web hosting providers offer some type of maintenance mode (sometimes called a “Coming Soon” page) which will hide your site from visitors. Instead, they will see a very simple page and/or greeting like "We'll be back soon" or "Page under construction." Depending on your web hosting provider the maintenance mode or Coming Soon page can be more colorful.

To find out how to enable this mode check the “Help” section or the “Knowledge Base” of your web hosting company. Many have step-by-step instructions.

## Enable Maintenance Mode With A Plugin

Choose this option if you don’t like the Coming Soon page provided by your hosting company, or if you would like to have more control over how the page appears to your visitors. And maintenance mode plugins can provide other benefits like allowing visitors to sign up to be notified when the site is live or have a chatbot talk to visitors.

The plugin I use that offers these features is [LightStart - Maintenance Mode, Coming Soon and Landing Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-maintenance-mode/). It allows you to create a page telling visitors your site is down for maintenance or a custom Coming Soon page. And you still have access to the admin dashboard so you can configure your site and add content.

The plugin’s settings allows you to display a countdown on your site which is a great way to buy excitement from your visitors. Or you can create a subscription form so you can collect the contact details from your interested visitors so you can notify them when your site is live. Finally, you can enable the chatbot to “speak” with your visitors using a set script you can create. Or use the pre-defined template provided by the plugin.
